# Notes on the Chapter

Hash Tables: A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values for highly efficient lookup.

ArrayLisst & Resizable Arrays: When you need an array-like data structure that offers dynamic resizing, you would usually use an Arraylist.
An Arraylist is an array that resizes itself as needed while still providing 0(1) access. A typical implementation is that when the array is full, the array doubles in size. Each doubling takes 0(n) time, but happens so rarely that its amortized insertion time is still O(1).

JavaScript does not have new StringBuilder() method

# Additional Practice

A good exercise to practice strings, arrays, and general data structures is to implement your own version of StringBuilder, HashTable and ArrayList.
