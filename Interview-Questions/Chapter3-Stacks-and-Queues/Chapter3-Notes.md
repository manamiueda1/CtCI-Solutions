# Stack Implementation

A stack uses LIFO (last-in first-out) ordering. In a stack of dinner plates, the most recent item added to the stack is the first item to be removed.

It uses the following operations:
pop(): Remove the top item from the stack. push(itern): Add an item to the top of the stack.
peek(): Return the top of the stack.
isEmpty(): Return true if and only if the stack is empty.

Unlike an array, a stack does not offer constant-time access to the ith item. However, it does allow constantÂ­ time adds and removes, as it doesn't require shifting elements around.
